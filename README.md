# RSHome

Just a little hobby project of mine.
It runs a Discord and Matrix chat bot in one process using the .NET service builder.
Also exposes a web frontend with some configuration.

The code may be useful to others as examples, but I doubt anyone will want to run this themselves if they are not me :-)
